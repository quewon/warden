title should be more..... fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!

'dangerous' aliens that:
- clone themselves
- steal words
- hijack your controls
- hijack music
- speak??
just wanna get them under control. no flying them out of airlocks.
some of these 'dangerous' aliens are misunderstood.

the experience:
- goal: collecting information and money.
- a small number of recurring characters

a tutorial that teaches you how to teach yourself the rules of the game, as well as forming a sort of backstory like
you were a kid on a ship hijacked by dumb space pirates
and they dragged in this crazy alien to get rid of everybody
but they didn’t know how to control it, and so they got attacked as well
but you survive by figuring out what it wants, what its nature is.

consistencies:
- everything on a grid
- permanence
- emoji language
