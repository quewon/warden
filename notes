warden

game where you are a warden beating sea creatures on a ship
puzzle style
like when you move the monsters move
and it’s ascii

but the monsters are weird
because they can clone themselves
and steal words
and hijack controls and music

you just wanna get them under control
you don’t wanna kill them
because you of all people know that they are thinking feeling creatures
though others may not

information you’ll have to gather on your own, and sometimes you will have to choose between gathering information and executing your plan
randomization
recurring characters
a hub where you work for specific companies and barter information
  if you leak information on how to warden something, you’ll be out of a job
  you gotta watch out for people that want your information in order to do bad things

training in the beginning — a tutorial that teaches you how to teach yourself the rules of the game, as well as forming a sort of backstory like
you were once a kid on a ship hijacked by dumb space pirates
and they dragged in this crazy monster to get rid of everybody
but they didn’t know how to control it, and so they got attacked as well
but you survive by figuring out what it wants, what its nature is.


aesthetics :
lighting, permanence
everything on a grid
