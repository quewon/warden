warden

you are a tiny warden that works on spaceships,
keeping dangerous aliens in check

being developed in pure javascript --
game is constantly updated live on github!

puzzle style
like when you move the monsters move
and it‚Äôs ascii

'dangerous' aliens that:
- clone themselves
- steal words
- hijack your controls
- hijack music
- speak??

you just wanna get them under control
you don‚Äôt wanna kill them
because you of all people know that they are thinking feeling creatures
though others may not

information you‚Äôll have to gather on your own, and sometimes you will have to choose between gathering information and executing your plan
randomization
recurring characters
a hub where you work for specific companies and barter information
  if you leak information on how to warden something, you‚Äôll be out of a job
  you gotta watch out for people that want your information in order to do bad things

training in the beginning ‚Äî a tutorial that teaches you how to teach yourself the rules of the game, as well as forming a sort of backstory like
you were once a kid on a ship hijacked by dumb space pirates
and they dragged in this crazy monster to get rid of everybody
but they didn‚Äôt know how to control it, and so they got attacked as well
but you survive by figuring out what it wants, what its nature is.

- doors are hardy aliens

design:
- no permadeath -- instead, you can't return to a level that you've failed, and getting neutralized has several disadvantages:
  - reputation decreasing
    - high profile companies refusing to work with you
    - having to work with illegals or pirates, who are less reliable
      - could refuse to pay you if something happens
      - might get you arrested at the border
      - might understate how dangerous the job is
  - miss out on information and job money

game loop:
1. acquire missions
  - companies
  - governments
  - pirates
  - just get a ticket
2. do mission
3. use money
  - acquire missions
  - go to different stations
  - broker information

goal of game:
acquire enough knowledge and friends(?) to find and take on the _.

like firefly, this game could have a number of player-settable goals. like fixing bad reputation. or getting x amount of money. character relationships could motivate this.

for some jobs, you have to acquire your own tickets. this means that the player has the ability to go on ships without having a job. you can be a passenger on a ship and gather information without losing reputation, but you'll lose cash and you can't access staff only zones.
