title should be more..... fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!

'dangerous' aliens that:
- clone themselves
- steal words
- hijack your controls
- hijack music
- speak??
just wanna get them under control. no flying them out of airlocks.
some of these 'dangerous' aliens are misunderstood.

the experience:
- goal: collecting information and money.
- a small number of recurring characters

a tutorial that teaches you how to teach yourself the rules of the game, as well as forming a sort of backstory like
you were a kid on a ship hijacked by dumb space pirates
and they dragged in this crazy alien to get rid of everybody
but they didn‚Äôt know how to control it, and so they got attacked as well
but you survive by figuring out what it wants, what its nature is.

consistencies:
- everything on a grid
- permanence
- emoji language

to do

[x] random aliens
[x] movement, collision, animation
[x] lighting and shadows
[ ] pulling aliens
[ ] ships

[ ] ray collision is leaky

[ ] configurable player speed
[ ] configurable palette

goal of game:
acquire enough knowledge and friends(?) to find and take on the _.

like firefly, this game could have a number of player-settable goals. like fixing bad reputation. or getting x amount of money. character relationships could motivate this.

for some jobs, you have to acquire your own tickets. this means that the player has the ability to go on ships without having a job. you can be a passenger on a ship and gather information without losing reputation, but you'll lose cash and you can't access staff only zones.
